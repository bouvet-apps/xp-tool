# Development

To start developing in xp-tool, install dependencies with `npm ci --ignore-scripts` (if you update packages in package.json, run `npm install --ignore-scripts`),
and run this version with `npm start` to test your code.

If you want to run the version you are working on locally from another project, you can run it by using `<path-to-local-repo>/xptool.js`.
